<!display have four catogery these are BLOCK,BLOCK-INLINE,INLINE and NONE
As you know every element is in box,so in our website h1 and p tags have block display which means that the width of the box of h1 and p tag covers whole space in the web page. >
<! Common block elements we used are "p","h1-h6","div","form","ol","ul","li".Here,we can change the width of the p tag.We can also change the display of block element to any other element.>
<!common Inline elements are "span","img","a".Here "a" is the anchor tag and span is also a tag which covers only the area around the text.As i use span in the above paragraph tag to edit or style the "inter" text.>
  <!Here,the other display element is "inline block" by using this we can change the width and use the inline element simultaneously.>
  <!The problem in span is we cant change the width of the span>
  <!The last display element is "none" and using this the element is just remove from the web page.>
     <! SEE VEDIO NUMBER 36 >
  <! We can also set a CSS property i.e position in order to position elements on screen the way that you wanted to.>
  <!IN CSS there are four layout by which we can change the position property and these are- "static,relative,absolute,fixed">
  <!1.Static- All html elements are by default static and static means just go along with the html rules and keep the default html flow.>
  <!2.Relative- For this read from styles.css>
  <!3. Absolute- Here,it means we are adding a margin to its parent element.>
  <!4. Fixed- It is used to fix the element.>
